</div>

## 🧠 Workshop Overview: Agentic AI Foundations with Microsoft AutoGen

This beginner-friendly, 8-hour workshop introduces you to the foundations of Agentic AI in data workflows. Ideal for data engineers, analysts, or anyone curious about how autonomous agents can support smarter decision-making, this hands-on session begins with [Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) a robust framework for designing, orchestrating, and automating multi-agent systems that tackle complex tasks through role-driven collaboration.


### ⚙️ Workshop Part 1: Designing Agentic AI Workflows with Microsoft AutoGen
#### 🚀 What You'll Build
- Agentic systems capable of task decomposition and coordination
- Modular workflows that combine prompt engineering, agent roles, and execution protocols
- Scalable automation pipelines that enhance data-centric operations

#### 🔍 Key Concepts
- **Agentic AI**: Systems designed to reason, collaborate, and execute autonomously
- **AutoGen**: Orchestration framework for multi-agent task automation with full visibility and termination control
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Leveraging agents to optimize data transformation, analysis, and insight generation

#### 🛠️ Hands-On Objectives
> You'll dive into [Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) to:
> - Learn how Agentic AI streamlines automation through role-driven coordination
> - Implement modular agents that communicate, delegate, and log execution paths
> - Build intelligent workflows that extend across data, prompt optimization, and diagnostics

#### 🔗 Looking Ahead
In Part 2, we’ll expand your agentic toolkit:
- Integrate with [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) for advanced memory and skill-based reasoning
- Apply [Crew AI](https://www.crewai.com/) to orchestrate larger-scale collaboration across diverse agent teams

#### 💡 Workshop Demo Disclaimer

All demos in this workshop have been tested and validated for expected performance. However, since LLMs are probabilistic and non-deterministic by design, prompt outcomes may vary between runs, even with identical inputs. Minor refinements like rephrasing, formatting tweaks, or few-shot examples may be required to consistently guide the model toward the intended output.

You're absolutely encouraged to:

- 🛠 Experiment with the provided prompt templates  
- ✍️ Modify system instructions to suit your use case  
- 🚀 Optimize and adapt prompts throughout the workshop

The goal is to empower you to shape and refine agent workflows to best fit your needs. Flexibility and exploration are part of the learning process, so feel free to make it your own!
