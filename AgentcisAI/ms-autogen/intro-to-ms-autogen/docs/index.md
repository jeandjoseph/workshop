In the first part of the workshop, you'll dive into [Microsoft Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html) to learn what Agentic AI is, how it can automate tasks, and how it enhances data workflows through multi-agent coordination. You'll get hands-on experience building intelligent systems using AutoGen before expanding into other tools like [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [Crew AI](https://www.crewai.com/) in part 2.

#### 💡 Workshop Demo Disclaimer

All demos in this workshop have been tested and validated for expected performance. However, since LLMs are probabilistic and non-deterministic by design, prompt outcomes may vary between runs, even with identical inputs. Minor refinements like rephrasing, formatting tweaks, or few-shot examples may be required to consistently guide the model toward the intended output.

You're absolutely encouraged to:

- 🛠 Experiment with the provided prompt templates  
- ✍️ Modify system instructions to suit your use case  
- 🚀 Optimize and adapt prompts throughout the workshop

The goal is to empower you to shape and refine agent workflows to best fit your needs. Flexibility and exploration are part of the learning process, so feel free to make it your own!
