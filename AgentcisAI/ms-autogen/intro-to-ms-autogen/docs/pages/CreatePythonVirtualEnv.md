## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Python Virtual Environment
A Python virtual environment is like a sandbox for your Python project. It isolates your dependencies so they don‚Äôt interfere with other projects or your system-wide Python installation.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Prerequisite:** 
1. Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any similar IDE and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed before proceeding with the virtual environment setup.
    * If the link doesn‚Äôt work, you can download VS Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and https://www.python.org/downloads/
#### üêç Step 1: Set Up Your Python Virtual Environment
- Create a new folder named **AIAgent**.
- Launch **VS Code** or any IDE you're comfortable using.
- Ensure your terminal‚Äôs working directory is set to the newly created `AIAgent` folder.
- Run the following command in the terminal to create a virtual environment named `autogenv5`:
  ```bash
  python -m venv autogenv5
  ```

#### ‚ö° Step 2: Activate Your Python Virtual Environment
   - üíª For **PowerShell on Windows** (other OS/shells may require a different command).
   - Navigate to your **Python Virtual Environment** folder.
   - Expand the environment directory to reveal its subfolders.
   - Open the **Scripts** folder inside the environment.
   - Right-click on `Activate.ps1`.
   - Select **Copy Path** from the context menu.

   - Open your terminal (PowerShell).
   - Paste the copied path directly into the terminal to activate the environment:
     ```powershell
     & "./autogenv5/Scripts/Activate.ps1"
   - You should see a screen similar to the one shown below.

   - Press **Enter** and wait until the exexution is done
   - Again, You should see a screen similar to the one shown below, with the relevant section highlighted in red. If this appears, you're all set to begin installing the dependencies.
