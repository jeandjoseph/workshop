Coordinating SQL Creation, Execution, and Reporting with AutoGen 0.4+
</h2>
This demo showcases how to build an end-to-end data engineering workflow using Microsoft AutoGenâ€™s multi-agent framework. By assigning distinct roles to specialized agents such as SQL script generation, saving, execution, and status reporting we demonstrate how complex tasks can be modularized and automated through intelligent agent coordination.


The goal is to highlight practical use of AutoGen 0.4+ features like SelectorGroupChat and MagneticOneGroupChat to manage task delegation and execution flow. This setup not only improves scalability and maintainability but also illustrates how multi-agent systems can streamline data operations in real-world scenarios.

<br>

This demo centers on using SelectorGroupChat to intelligently coordinate agent interactions, ensuring each task is routed to the agent best suited for its role and context. For a deeper dive into team-based chat strategies, feel free to explore the [Team GroupChat documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/index.html).

        Your responsibilities are:
        1. Write a Python script that:
            - Accepts a list of T-SQL scripts, each represented as a dictionary with keys like `name` and `content`.
            - Saves each script into a separate `.sql` file in the working directory.
            - Uses the `name` field to generate the filename (e.g., `name.sql`). If `name` is missing, use a fallback like `script_1.sql`, `script_2.sql`, etc.
            - At the END of your codes Confirm that all `.sql` files have been saved successfully.
        2. Follow these strict formatting rules:
        - Do NOT execute any code.
        - Respond with a single Python code block formatted in markdown:
            ```python

        - Do NOT include explanations, comments, or multiple code blocks.
