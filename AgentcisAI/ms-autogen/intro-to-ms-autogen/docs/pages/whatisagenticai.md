  <h2>Demystify the core concept of Agentic AI</h2>
</div>

## 🔍 What Is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI systems consist of **goal-driven agents** that:
- Autonomously **reason**, **plan**, and **act** toward an objective.
- Collaborate via **multi-agent orchestration**, often using tools like [Microsoft AutoGen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/index.html).
- Are **modular**, **stateful**, and adapt based on environment feedback.

> Think: not just answering a question, but coordinating tasks, escalating issues, and deciding what to do next, like a team of specialists, not just assistants.

## 🚀 Why Is Agentic AI Needed?
While traditional LLMs tend to respond passively to prompts, Agentic AI introduces initiative and coordination to elevate system capabilities. Specifically, Agentic AI:
- Enables **automation** of complex workflows beyond one-shot prompting.
- Supports **decision-making chains**, persistent memory, and task decomposition.
- Improves **auditability**, **debuggability**, and delivers **live feedback** throughout execution.


Especially vital for:
- Reducing human bottlenecks
- Scaling systems across departments
- Adapting in real time to new data or objectives
