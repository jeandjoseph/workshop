## 🔍 What Is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI systems consist of **goal-driven agents** that:
- Autonomously **reason**, **plan**, and **act** toward an objective.
- Collaborate via **multi-agent orchestration**, often using tools like Microsoft AutoGen.
- Are **modular**, **stateful**, and adapt based on environment feedback.

> Think: not just answering a question, but coordinating tasks, escalating issues, and deciding what to do next—like a team of specialists, not just assistants.

## 🚀 Why Is Agentic AI Needed?
Traditional LLMs respond passively. Agentic AI:
- Enables **automation** of complex workflows (beyond 1-shot prompts).
- Supports **decision-making chains**, memory use, and task decomposition.
- Improves **auditability**, **debuggability**, and **live feedback**.

Especially vital for:
- Reducing human bottlenecks
- Scaling systems across departments
- Adapting in real time to new data or objectives
