## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Your Environment Ready

üß∞ Before diving into the workshop, let‚Äôs set up your Python environment and install the required libraries.

üßë‚Äçüíª **Prerequisite:** 
1. Make sure you have [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or any similar IDE and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed before proceeding with the virtual environment setup.
    * If the link doesn‚Äôt work, you can download VS Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. You need an Azure OpenAI or OpenAI subscription to deploy one or more types of generative AI models. Alternatively, you‚Äôre free to download a model locally if you prefer managing it yourself.

    - For the Microsoft Azure platform, please follow these instructions:
        1. Sign up for a [free subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) or use your existing Azure subscription.
        2. Create an [AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/) workspace to manage and host your models.
        3. Deploy a model of your choice.  
            - For this workshop, we're using gpt-4.1-nano to optimize cost. If you use a different model, you may need to adjust your prompt to suit its specific behavior.
            - You can browse other models in the AI Foundry interface based on your needs.
        4. Copy, and paste the following details into a plain text file:
            - API endpoint URL
            - API key
            - Model version
        5. Create a new folder (for instance, name it `AIAgent`) to keep your project structure clean and secure.
        6. Copy and paste the text below into a notepad. Update it with the latest information, then save the file as .env (an environment configuration file) inside the newly created folder.
           ```text
           MODEL='gpt-4.1-nano'
           API_KEY='<your azure openai api key>'
           BASE_URL='https:/<your azure openai api endpoint>.openai.azure.com/'
           API_TYPE='azure'
           API_VERSION='<your azure openai model version>'
           DEPLOYMENT_NAME='<your azure openai model deployment name>'
           ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup Overview

üì¶ **First**, to begin, you'll need to create two separate Python virtual environments to keep dependencies isolated and projects reproducible.  
   ‚Üí Follow this guide: [Creating Python Virtual Environments](../pages/CreatePythonVirtualEnv.md)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Environment 1 ‚Äì AutoGen SDK for Azure OpenAI
- üåê [Install AutoGen SDK for Azure OpenAI API](../pages/InstallAutoGenAgentChatAPI.md)
- Set up core libraries to orchestrate agents programmatically using the Azure OpenAI API.
- Ideal for building scalable workflows and experimenting with custom agents in code.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Environment 2 ‚Äì AutoGen Studio
- üß™ [Install AutoGen Studio](../pages/InstallAutogenStudio.md)
- Launch the Studio interface for designing, testing, and managing agents visually.
- Use Studio to quickly prototype and debug agent behaviors without writing code.

‚úÖ Each environment serves a different purpose, and separating them helps avoid conflicts between dependencies.



> ‚úÖ Complete both installations before proceeding to hands-on tasks or demos.
