💡 Whether you're a developer or domain expert, AutoGen Studio 0.4+ makes it easier to harness LLMs for real-world applications **with minimal coding and maximal flexibility**.

⚠️ Disclaimer AutoGen Studio is a research prototype that’s constantly evolving—its interface, features, and workflow behaviors change often, which means written guides may quickly become outdated. Live demos are the most reliable way to explore its current state, especially experimental features like live streaming or mid-execution control. If you’re joining my live workshop, stay tuned—I’ll walk through it live to show you exactly how it works today.

If you're not joining the live workshop session, you'll receive step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure and launch [AutoGen Studio](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/index.html), plus links to helpful tutorials on Microsoft Learn and YouTube.
