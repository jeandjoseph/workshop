## üß† Understanding `SelectorGroupChat` in Microsoft AutoGen

`SelectorGroupChat` is a coordination mode where **only one agent responds at a time**, hand-picked for its relevance to the task or prompt. Unlike traditional group chat strategies that allow multiple responses (like `RoundRobinGroupChat`), this method keeps interactions **focused and streamlined**.

---

### üéØ How It Works

- A controller or selection logic chooses **one agent** to reply.
- Other agents stay silent or observe during that round.
- The next prompt may trigger a new selection, ensuring that only the most relevant agent speaks each time.

---

### üí° Why Use It?

This mode is ideal when:
- You need a **clear, single-point answer** (e.g., a domain expert).
- You want to **avoid clutter** from overlapping or redundant replies.
- You're simulating real-life dynamics, where a leader or specialist takes the spotlight.

### üî¨ Comparison with Other Modes

| Mode                  | Response Style               | Use Case                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `RoundRobinGroupChat`| All agents take turns         | Panel-style debates, brainstorming     |
| `SelectorGroupChat` | One agent responds per round  | Expert Q&A, focused dialog             |
