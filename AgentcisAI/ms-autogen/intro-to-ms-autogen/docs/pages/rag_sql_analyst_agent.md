## Agentic SQL RAG Analyst: A Multi-Agent Orchestration Demo
Welcome to the **Agentic SQL RAG Analyst** demo, your gateway into orchestrating intelligent, multi-agent collaboration using Microsoft AutoGen 0.4+. This walkthrough showcases how to design an end-to-end agentic pipeline that retrieves structured sales data from SQL Server, enhances it through analytical reasoning, and transforms it into compelling visual insights. 

You’ll see how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) principles are adapted to SQL workflows, where agents coordinate through clearly defined roles: fetching facts, computing business metrics, and rendering professional-grade charts. By the end, you’ll understand how to build reproducible, asynchronous multi-agent systems that are scalable, demo-ready, and deeply modular—all with the latest AutoGen best practices.


🛠️ **Why You Should Pre-Create and Assign Tools**
- 🔒 **Control & Security**: When you define the tool, you control what it does, what it accesses, and how it handles data. If an agent could create tools dynamically, you'd risk unexpected behavior or unclear boundaries.
- 🧩 **Modularity**: Prebuilt tools are reusable, testable, and versioned independently. You can validate a FunctionTool, swap it, or share it across agents just like components in a microservice architecture.
- 📚 **Auditability**: When tools are constructed declaratively (in code) and injected into agents, you maintain a clean provenance of who can do what, using which tool, and for what purpose. That's crucial for debugging, education, and compliance.
- 🚦**Agent Behavior Shaping**: Tools + system messages define the sandbox in which agents operate. Without them, agents would need to infer behavior or generate logic which leads to ambiguity or hallucinated APIs.
