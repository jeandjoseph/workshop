## 🧠 Understanding `Swarm` in Microsoft AutoGen

In Microsoft AutoGen 0.4+, a [`Swarm`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/swarm.html) is a coordination pattern where multiple agents contribute in parallel, each offering role-specific input. A proxy or selector agent dynamically aggregates these responses forwarding, combining, or discarding them as needed, creating an intelligent, non-linear hand-off process that mirrors a collaborative brainstorming session without hardwired agent-to-agent dependencies.
